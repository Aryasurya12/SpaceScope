Ion propulsion is a type of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.
The key advantage of ion propulsion is its high specific impulse (ISP), which represents fuel efficiency. Ion thrusters can have an ISP of over 3000 seconds, compared to ~450 seconds for chemical rockets.
However, the thrust generated is very low (comparable to the weight of a piece of paper).
This makes ion engines ideal for long-duration deep space missions where high efficiency is more important than high thrust.
Examples of missions using ion propulsion include NASA's Dawn spacecraft (which visited Vesta and Ceres) and Deep Space 1.
The NEXT-C ion thruster is one of NASA's most advanced evolutionary xenon thrusters.
